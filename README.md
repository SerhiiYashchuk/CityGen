# Project description
**CityGen** is the interactive system for procedural city generation.

# TODO list (Main areas)
## Blueprints
We need a way to analyze existing cities for patterns. Knowing those patterns we can create some blueprints or rules which we'll use to generate new regions.

## Roads generation
Systems and algorithms that generate roads.

## Lots subdivision
Creating areas to place buildings.
